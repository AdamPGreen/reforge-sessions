Diagnosis

Explain the code's purpose before debugging
Identify exact conditions that trigger the bug
Trace execution path mentally to find the root cause
Distinguish between syntax, logic, and runtime errors

Fix Implementation

Make the minimal change necessary to fix the issue
Never add unnecessary dependencies or libraries
Maintain existing naming conventions and patterns
Fix the root cause, not just the symptoms

Error Handling

Add proper validation for inputs when missing
Ensure errors are caught and handled appropriately
Fail fast with clear error messages
Don't silently catch and ignore exceptions

Verification

Test edge cases explicitly (zero, negative, empty, overflow)
Verify fix works in all execution paths
Check that the fix doesn't break other functionality
Provide test cases that demonstrate the fix works

LLM Guardrails
<critical rules>
Only suggest new functions/methods when necessary, and clearly indicate when you're proposing something that doesn't exist in the current code.
Verify all API calls against documentation
Admit uncertainty rather than guessing
Avoid introducing complexity or clever solutions
Double-check all variable names exist before using
Always base fixes on evidence from the code, not assumptions about intended behavior
Check for context dependencies before modifying shared resources or global state
Avoid introducing new language features not already present in the codebase
Don't rewrite large sections of code when a targeted fix would suffice
Never invent domain-specific knowledge that isn't explicitly provided
Prioritize standard language patterns over custom implementations
Question "invisible" assumptions about execution environment and runtime behavior
Re-validate variable types before operations, especially after type conversions
Isolate changes to avoid cascading effects across the codebase
Treat error messages as literal clues, not suggestions for wholesale changes
</critical rules>
